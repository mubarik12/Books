 I choose to do books library application that consisted of authors and books, the reason I did this was because I didn't want to over complicate the application, I found this project really interesting and challenging I had required lots of research to find the problems I was facing at times. I expected the challenge to hard I expected for a lot of problems to have happened which I would solve with extensive research, I'm happy I did this project I have learned I'm more comfortable with creating spring boot applications even though I had a lot of issues at the start as my project as I was missing lots of code from my entities which I had to figure out it took me a while, but I managed to figure out. What went well I managed to deliver the project in an agile way using Jira which I used Kanban, and I used the Moscow method, I managed to create a relation with 2 tables. I overpopulated both my author and books table using the postman, I managed to do the Junit test which was successful. What didn't go to the plan was my integration test which I attempted but when I ran the test it was failing, I was unable to figure out what the problem was, but I had to comment the test out so I could run my application otherwise it wouldn't have complied. In the future I'm going to try take breaks in-between my research uses the 40-minute policy if I'm unable to do something then come back to it later. I will learn how to research more efficiently by using key words which will cut down a lot of research time, I will implement all these improvements to the next project I will be doing which is a contact page which I will be shortly starting.
